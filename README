README

This is a bash script written for kiddos learning math in grade school for the 0 through 10 math.  Currently the script can be run and will do the following:

- What is your name?
- Addition or Subtraction
- Level (repeated number)
- Keeps track of correct vs incorrect 
- Hit l for level change (resets correct vs incorrect)
- Hit t for changing addition or subtraction (resets correct vs incorrect)
- Hit x to exit (gives summary of current level)

Wrote this for my daughter when she hit first grade...

enjoy...
